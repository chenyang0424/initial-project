All of our routes will be set in 'src/routes/...' files.

styles folder contains all kinds of stylesheets such as '.less/.sass/.css'.

Home and Counter routers are two examples whitch can be modified as other names.

All logical codes are only in 'src/routes/' folder.


Attention:
It's better to make the codes style keep a conformity even if different persons join in the project.
For example, a tab should be the length of four empty spaces. Different sentences
should be devided with semicolon(;) and wrap mark. Keywords and next codes are connected with an empty space.
Welcome to use ES6 grammar editing codes!
